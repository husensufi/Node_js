/*Problem 5 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

You're working on a weather app. Create a JSON object representing the weather forecast for a specific day. 
Include properties like "date" "temperature," "conditions," and "humidity." Display the information using console.log

Remember to encourage your students to experiment and think creatively while solving these problems.
 They can use the concepts you've taught them to come up with their own solutions. 
 This will not only help solidify their understanding but also foster their problem-solving skills in JavaScript*/

const date = new Date();

const whether = {

    "Date ": date,
    "tempreture": "25 *C",
    "condition": "Cold",
    "Humidity": "Rainy",
     
}
 console.log(whether);
